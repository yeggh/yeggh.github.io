<p>Recently, scene perception has been accomplished through object detection, and semantic segmentation in 2D camera images, and LiDAR sensors. One of the important uses of this study is in self-driving cars application. Scene perception can have a significant impact on human life by reducing driving hazards, preventing harmful behaviors, and increasing travel safety. Although AI research is very advanced in 2D object detection, and it is considered a solved issue in a good environment, it still remains a challenging problem in more complex conditions (e.g. rainy days, dim light, etc). <br />
Camera images provide high-resolution color and texture attributes, but they are not prone to weather and light conditions and suffer from a lack of depth estimation. On the other hand, the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor is an active point-and-shoot device that can re-create the car's surroundings in the form of 3D points (i.e. point cloud). This point cloud is not affected by</p>
