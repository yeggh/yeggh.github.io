Recently, scene perception has been accomplished through object detection, and semantic segmentation in 2D camera images, and LiDAR sensors. One of the important uses of this study is in self-driving cars application. Scene perception can have a significant impact on human life by reducing driving hazards, preventing harmful behaviors, and increasing travel safety. Although AI research is very advanced in 2D object detection, and it is considered a solved issue in a good environment, it still remains a challenging problem in more complex conditions (e.g. rainy days, dim light, etc). \n
Camera images provide high-resolution color and texture attributes, but they are not prone to extreme weather and light conditions and suffer from a lack of depth estimation. On the other hand, the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor is an active point-and-shoot device that can re-create the car's surroundings in the form of 3D points (i.e. point cloud). The point cloud is not affected by illumination conditions, but it is hard to process this data since it is sparse, irregular, and deprived of characteristics offered by camera images.
